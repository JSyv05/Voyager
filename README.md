## Objective
Voyager was a project that I worked on for a class, and it turned out to be one of the most fun and exciting things that I had ever worked on. After the class concluded, I decided to fork the original project and begin working on it for my own personal interest. Any of the former team members that worked on the original project are totally free to join. This will be what Voyager was intended to be.
